# Randomize-In-Place
A website that demonstrates how the Randomize-In-Place algorithm works.
It steps through the animation of the algorithm on a set of 16 numbers, and it highlights pseudo-code to represent what the algorithm is currently doing at that step. The current position and the current random slot that is selected are both highlighted in the animation, and then the numbers are swapped. There is also a reset button to reset the animation back to its original state.
